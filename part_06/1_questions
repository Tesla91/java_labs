1) What is Java inheritance?
The ability of one class to inherit the traits of another class.

2) How does inheritance work?
With the keyword extends.

3) What are some advantages that inheritance provides?
Being able to use code without having to rewrite/redefine them in every class.

4) What does the "super" keyword do?
It calls the constructor/variable from the super class
It is like using the "this" keyword but from the super class.

5) In what order are constructors called when there are multiple subclasses?
The super class is called first and then the sub classes.

6) What does it mean when a method is overridden?
When you have a method in the super class and you call it in the subclass and you give it the same parameters.

7) How do overridden methods support polymorphism?
By enabling you to create a generalized method structure that can be implemented by a variety of methods.

8) What is the difference between an overloaded method and an overridden method?
An overloaded method is when a method is given different parameters. An overridden method is where you call it
from the superclass and give it the same.

9) What is dynamic method dispatch?
Is the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time rather than compile time.

10) What does the "final" keyword do?
Prevents Overriding and Inheritance.

11) All classes in Java are a subclass of what super class?
The Object Class
